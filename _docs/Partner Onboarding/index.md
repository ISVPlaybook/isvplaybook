## Overview

The onboarding process for partners is a critical step in the partner lifecycle. It is the first step in the journey to becoming a partner with Microsoft. The onboarding process is designed to help partners understand the requirements and expectations of the partnership, as well as to provide partners with the tools and resources they need to be successful.

## Getting Started

To get started with the onboarding process, partners should review the information provided in this section. Partners should also review the information provided in the [Partner Center](/docs/partnercenter/) section, as this section contains additional information about the partner portal and other tools and resources that partners will need to access during the onboarding process.

## Next Steps

After partners complete the onboarding process, they can access the partner dashboard and start using the partner resources. For more information, see [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/).
